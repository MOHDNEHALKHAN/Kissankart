# Kissankart🧑🏻‍🌾

Kissankart is a farmer-first marketplace that enables producers to sell harvests and farm inputs directly to consumers, retailers, and fellow farmers—reducing middlemen and improving margins. Sellers create listings, set transparent prices, manage inventory, and receive secure payments via Razorpay or Stripe. Buyers discover nearby produce and supplies, compare prices, leverage bulk/collective purchasing for better rates, and check out securely. Authenticated users can track orders and manage profiles, while sellers gain basic insights to optimize pricing and demand.
